# R-data-science
An aggregation of my interesting R-data-science projects
1. This project employs xgboost to predict death risk using the California Teachers Study(CTS) data: [https://github.com/yungson/CTS-death-prediction](https://github.com/yungson/CTS-death-prediction)

2. Using Regression Analysis in R to expore the association of clinical characteristics with heart failure: [https://github.com/yungson/R-regression](https://github.com/yungson/R-regression)

3. A interactive data dashboard of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: [https://github.com/yungson/COVID-19-US](https://github.com/yungson/COVID-19-US)

4. use MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) method to crack the encrypted codes: [https://github.com/yungson/code-cracking](https://github.com/yungson/code-cracking)

5. Using a moran's statistics to do hypothesis tests to judge whether a grid is random or not: [https://github.com/yungson/moran-statistics](https://github.com/yungson/moran-statistics)
